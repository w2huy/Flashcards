## Flashcards

## Lab 2

### App Description
Our Flashcard app and focus on how to add and customize views to be displayed on the screen. By the end of this lab you should have a basic Flashcard app that can display a question, and on tap display the answer to the question. We're able to create a new screen where users can create new flashcards right from the app. Whenever you want to study something new you can just create a new flashcard!
