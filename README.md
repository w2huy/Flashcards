## Flashcards

## Lab 3

### App Description
In this lab we will make our app finally a fully functional app that you can actually use to study and ship on the App Store (but don't ship it yet, wait for Lab 4 where we will add some magic âœ¨). We're going to allow users to create as many flashcards as they want, browse through them and persist them even if they close the app. While building this you will learn how to store data and how to write more complex logic.

## Lab 2

### App Description
Our Flashcard app and focus on how to add and customize views to be displayed on the screen. By the end of this lab you should have a basic Flashcard app that can display a question, and on tap display the answer to the question. We're able to create a new screen where users can create new flashcards right from the app. Whenever you want to study something new you can just create a new flashcard!
